# gallivant
Exploratory testing tool

"No matter how many test cases of how many types youâ€™ve created, you will run out of formally planned tests. You can keep testing.  Run new tests as you think of them, without spending much time preparing or explaining the tests. Trust your instincts." - Cem Kaner, Testing Computer Software
